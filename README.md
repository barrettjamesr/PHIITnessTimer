# PHIITnessTimer
An app I made to help my workouts and fitness training analysis

pHIITness Timer is a Personal High Intensity Interval Training (PHIIT) stopwatch designed for those training without a coach or a buddy watching the clock and cheering you on. It has six different timers, designed to cover the typical Crossfit WODs as well as other standard interval training styles. If you come across a WOD style we haven't covered, please let us know!

 - Rounds For Time
 - AMRAP
 - AMRAP Repeats
 - Tabata
 - Circuits / FGB
 - EMOM

For Rounds-for-time or AMRAP wods, you can count rounds by tapping the screen, your splits will be displayed on completion. For tabata or circuit workouts, you can enter the reps during the rest period and see the totals at the end.

Full archive of previous timers is available, with the ability to save pre-set timers available in future versions.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact us at phiitness.timer@gmail.com. Before immediately leaving a negative review, we would appreciate if you could send us an email with constructive feedback instead, so we can try to resolve any issues.

Thanks for downloading. Hope you enjoy the app and that it helps you on your pHIITness journey!
